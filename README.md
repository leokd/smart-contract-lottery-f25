# Proveably random raffle contracts 

## What do we want to do it?
1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
    1. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw 
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
    1. This will be done programatically
3. Using Chalink VRF & Chainlink Automation
    1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
    2. Chainlink Automation -> Time based triggers 

## Tests

1. Write deploy scripts 
    1. Note, this will not work on Zksync
2. Write tests 
    1. Local chain 
    2. Forked testnet
    3. Forked mainnet
